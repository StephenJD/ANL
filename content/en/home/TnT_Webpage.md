    permission and give your parent\'s contact phone number.

-   You are free to come and go as you please.

-   Show respect to the leaders and each other.

-   Use of mobile-phones is fine, as long as it is not
    offensive,Â disrespectful or disturbing others

-   Please use the public toilets rather than the one in the Parish
    Room.

-   No smoking, alcohol or drugs on the premises.

-   If a TnT helper asks you to modify your behaviour and you do not,
    you will be asked to leave.

# Safeguarding

arrangements and Volunteer Role descriptions. All TnT leaders and
helpers are DBS checked and have received Safeguarding training.
