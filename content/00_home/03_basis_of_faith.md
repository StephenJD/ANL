# Ascend Next Level – Basis of Faith

Directors of Next Level believe in one God–made known to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit–and that the Bible is God’s inspired and authoritative Word, revealing that all people are created in God’s image; that God desires friendship with us and has made this possible through the birth, life, death, resurrection and ascension of His Son, Jesus Christ; that the Holy Spirit inspires and invites us to repentance, faith and obedience to God; and that God works through us to accomplish Jesus’ commandments to love one another and go and make disciples of all the nations.
